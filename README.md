# ATM-Database-Management-System
This project is basically creating a database management system for the transaction that are
being taken place in the ATM of any bank. Aim of the project is to creating a backend
program of the processes taking place using SQL. This model deals with the relationship
between the customer, ATM machine & Bank. The other entities play a supportive weak
role. So basically this helps the banks to debit or credit the amount of the customer from his
respective account and also keep the record of his/her transaction made.
